(Idea Jan, approved: 1)
-The game is made up of stages. 
-The stages are linear at first but can divide into branches which always have a way to get back to the main branch.
-A stage can be a mixture of lore/story and questions. 
-The questions decide which path is taken in the story. 
(for example: You don’t have much fuel left in your ships tank. 
You get a formular and some numbers and you have to calculate how far you can get with what’s left in the tank of the ship. 
If you answer correct you can easily refuel on the next civilized planet. 
if you fail you crash on an abandon planet and you have to make the fuel yourself.)

=> diagrams for demonstration would be great
