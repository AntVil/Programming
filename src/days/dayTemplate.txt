It won't be displayed 
It starts and ends with the percent sign

These Characters (and the percent-character) are markers used for reading the files:

$   (story-start/-end)
{   (interaction-start)
}   (interaction-end)
@   (Restriction)
<   (option-start)
>   (option-end)
[   (style-change)
]   (style-normalize)
#   (Consequence)


These characters control the style of text:
r   (red)
g   (green)
b   (blue)
_   (underline)
+   (bold)


This character controls text-variables:
~N  (name)


Most markers can still be used in normal text, as they are used semantically diffrent.
But if errors occur try to use diffrent characters.

Text here is not displayed as well, but it should be put into a comment to prevent errors!
