[gDay 4]

It has been a short night full of anxiety and bad dreams. Have you made the right choices? What if you don't make it alive? 
These thoughts and many more have been haunting you, so you get up to check the status instruments. You sit there for a while staring at the screen, as you begin to realize:
$

@Language = English & StoryBlock = 5.0 & lessPower = true$
The power levels of the ship are getting dangerously low. 

[benergy efficiency: ][r6/100][b (6% of the original performance)]

You have to do something about that, or, if your estimation is correct, you have little chances of survival. As you float into the reactor room, the control section shows critical status.
Although you had learned nearly all about this reactor, you have no idea what to do now. Inspecting and repairing the reactor is impossible while it's running. To do that you would have
to shut it down...

I won't make it with that little power, I have to shut it down and try to repair it.

Maybe the energy could last... but till when? Anyway, better keep the reactor running.
#StoryBlock = 5.1.2

@Language = English & StoryBlock = 5.1.1$

You enter the safety code to power the reactor down, the energy levels sink to a minimum, only providing the live-essential systems with power from the big battery. 
Let's get to work. 
You make your way to the storage section.

@Language = English & StoryBlock = 5.1.1 & Items = none$
The only useful things you can find in there are some measuring instruments for electrical current and a radiation meter. You have to think about your toolbag, that you left out there in the 
cosmos. It might've been useful now.

After a few minutes in the reactor section - you realize: Without your tools it could be impossible to fix the reactor - you don't like to say it out loud, but you get a feeling that gets uncomfortably stronger: 
You are doomed...
$


@Language = English & StoryBlock = 5.1.1 & Items = toolbag$
You are more than glad that you got your toolbag right now, the only thing that could help you out in this situation. You grab it and head back to the reactor room.

That might take a while.

Damn it. Instead of your toolbag, the crystal lies at it's place, glowing in innocence, while your fate depends on repairing a nuclear reactor... You feel angry about yourself for choosing
this [+THING] instead of your toolbag. 
Dejected you stare at its glow. 

The following hours you spend trying all different kinds of repair actions on the reactor, but it's pointless... Without the necessary tools there's nothing you can do.
Discouraged you float through the ship, the crystal in your hands. As you come by the reactor section, you notice the stone glowing a little brighter. As you enter the room, it's glow gets
almost to strong to directly look at it. You take a glimse at the control monitor, you are able to detect a flimmering image: 

[benergy efficiency: ][r6/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][r9/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][r13/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][r18/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][r25/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][r31/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][g38/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][g46/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][g58/100]

What? How is that possible? You hold the stone closer to the reactor.

[benergy efficiency: ][g67/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][g85/100]
[benergy efficiency: ][g100/100]

You have never seen something like this before... the crystal was a source of energy, much more powerful than anything known to men. The last goal now, is to get to
your destination, and now that the reactor is functioning, that should be the lesser problem.
