[gDay 2]

You had a hard time sleeping last night. The fact that there was this anomaly in time and space, an undiscovered phenomenon right in front of you,
was just too exciting and frightening at once. You got up way before your time this morning, staring at the screen, while the navigation device was running.

In a short moment of regret, you think about the chance you are missing, being the first human to fly inside of a wormhole, a real one. But you catch your thoughts fast: 
What's it matter anyway, when you are 99.9% DEAD if you'd do it??

...but your eyes... they are still tired, and without realising, you chose the input that would lead your ship right into the wormhole.
A moment later, you squint your eyes and you know, the course can't be changed no more, and maybe... maybe it was destiny.
