You have no possibilty of either repairing the reactor, nor calling for help. The ships condition gets worse with every minute. And therefoe any minute could be your last one. 
You think about Vlad. Maybe you would see him again. 

Then the pressure control system runs out of power. 

You look at the earth one last time...
then you close your eyes.

[gDay 5]

It's been a few hours since you arrived. You arrived at home. Not in the sense of being there where you live. But on a cosmic scale.
But how is this possible? 
The toolbag that you saw... 
And the seemingly low speed of travel while being in the wormhole...


[gDay 97]

It all went down really fast in the past 3 months: After you had contacted the space control center, a rescue mission had been sent in record time. On earth meanwhile, many things had changed. 
Basically all you had known was gone. Roughly 16 Years after you left, a great war ended the governmental systems of all the countrys, and the people decided to bond togehter to build humanitys progress together. 
You landed in cape canaveral, a place you thought you'd never visit, it had always been on the enemy's land. 
The answers to all the open questions were found by leading scientists of the world. Nevertheless, to this day, it still sounds unbelievable to you:

Even though your journey took you 4 years, the time on earth has progressed much faster, the year of your arrival was 2114. Also you learned what had happened to the other Sputnik missions...
Only one of them made it into space safely, the other ship detonated the moment it left the stratosphere. 

[bYou:]"So the toolbag I saw..." 
[rProf. Peterson:] "Yes, it wasn't yours. It was part of the detonated ships interieur."
[bYou:] "But I had seen it when I was more than 12,155e+7 km from earth. Did it enter the wormhole from the other side? How is it possible we could't recognize it if it ends right near the earth?"

You are not sure if you understood the explaination prof. Peterson gave to you, it seemed logical, but still insane.

The crystal has been analyzed notoriously, but there are still many things unclear about it.
Sometimes, you drive to the laboratory, Sundays in the early morning, and just look at like you did when you first found it. 
It still leaves you speechless.

At the ceremony two weeks ago, you received the award for extraterrestrial discovery from the united republic, and it was also Vladimirs metaphorical funeral. 
With tears in your eyes you looked at his grave. 
He would have been proud.
