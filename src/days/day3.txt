[gDay 3]

Tody is the day. After a short night you prepare everything on the ship for the jump. As you approach the coordinates of the entrance point, the starlight seems to get dimmer, 
all the stars you see are now warping behind you, leaving only darkness in front of you. Suddenly, all the stars are gone and you can't locate the source of light that is still 
present, it looks unreal, as if the space itself was slightly glowing. 
From this point on you feel like everything you perceive has no real connection to all the things you've known for your whole life - the instuments in the control room don't show any
valid data, looking out the small window gives you a feeling of slight dizziness, even though there is nothing outside but this strange glow.
Are you in yet? Why is this route not feeling "faster"? According to your calculations your speed should now be over 6000 km/s. 
You look out the window again. Is that a toolbag? Is that [+YOUR] Toolbag?? Must be, but how did it get out there? Sh*t.
Now you gotta act fast. What will you do?

I have to get out there. Without these tools I am helpless in the event of an error. Let me get my spacesuit.

It's too risky to get out there. You have to think about what happened a year ago... you don't want that to happen again.

Suiting up has been your favourite part of the spacewalks at the times when Vlad was still with you - now you have to help yourself with getting into the airtight material's many layers.
Vladimir Lituskij was the second kosmonaut on board of the SPUTNIK 2078, until the horrible incident last year. You don't like to think about it for too long, so you don't. 
Approaching the hatch to leave the spaceship, you turn around and check your safety cord.
The display on the side of the exit says

Door's jamming again. Typical. You give it a strong punch to help.

As the hermetic door opens, you grab onto the siderails to avoid being sucked out by the enormous pressure of the air, that is shooting out the door opening. With it getting wider and wider,
revealing the open space, you look around and check your safety cord again. Without it, there would be no chance of getting back onto the ship, you would be lost in the eternal and never 
ending depths of empty space. 
Floating outside the SPUTNIK was a majestic scenery, the unpainted metal reflected in the mysterious glow, and for a short moment you were caught in this sight, before proceeding to approach the toolbag.
The never ending view into the dark made the 60 meters seem shorter than expected, a few times you were worried that your cord would not be long enough. 
Finally, you get in range of the toolbag, and you can almost grab it but... your attention shifts towards another item, floating not far from you. It's pulsating glow has a strange effect on your eyes.
You turn around and focus it for a while, trying to figure out what it is. There is a feeling... inside of you... that attracts you to it. 

Now you are right between the two items, and you have to descide which one to take with you, the timer on your built in display shows the little time you have left, before the oxygen in your Suit
will be gone.

For a short moment you are not sure if that was the correct decision, but it was the safer one for sure. Though, as you are on your way back to the ship, 
slowly pulling yourself closer, you cannot resist looking back at the chrystal - slowly vanishing in the deep dark.
With the toolbag in your hands, holding it tight, you get to the ship.
When the hermetic door finally closes behind you, and you look out the little window, you get a last glimse at the light of it, warm and cold at the same time. 
The toolbag is still in your hands.

You float towards the shining thing, it starts glowing brighter as you approach it, and you could swear it came a bit closer to you in the moment you grabbed it. Inspecting it a little, you notice:
it's surface consists of many little chrystals, forming grooves and wrinkles like canyons, in which all the light seems to get lost, warm and cold at the same time, way deeper than you can see.
You hold the stone firm in your left hand, while you pull yourself back to the ship. You feel it slightly vibrating in your hand, a feeling as if it wasn't just any crystal, unlike anything you've ever encountered
on earth or on your journey so far. 
You don't even think about the toolbag you left behind in space, the stone seems like the only important thing to you right now.

Finally you approach the Sputnik, and a few moments later the hermetic door closes behind you, seperating the dark from the light and giving you a sense of security again. 
Before you even think about getting out of your spacesuit, you inspect the chrystal closer for a while, you almost can't get your eyes off it. You get up and look around, then at the crystal again.
What should you do with it?

You look at the stone - with more fear in your eyes. Could it be a bad decision to keep it? Do you really want to take that risk? 
No.
You carry it to the waste ejector module, put it in the container, and look at it's beauty for the last time. 
Then you press the button. 

It's gone.
Suddenly, the ship gets a little colder. Or maybe it was just you...

You rarely think about it, because that's what you're trained to do. Blending out negative memorys and keeping your emotions under control is one of the key abilitys the space program recruiters look for. 
Vlad also had them, and maybe he was better at it than you are. 
Vladimir Lituskij was the second kosmonaut on board of the SPUTNIK 2078, until the horrible incident last year.
You two passed the selection process together, and had become close friends during the training and first years of the space journey.

It happened near the xiastea-63507 asteroid belt, where you were supposed to extract minerals in order to fill up our resources. 
The rock that hit him weighed more than 3 tons, he had no chance of surival. The collision of two nearby asteroids caused the rocks to fire at your location, there were craters everywhere after the dust went away. 
The majority of mineral crates were already on board, but all those that were still outside were lost. Just as Vlad.

You look around and seem lost.
It has been a rough day, and it has become very late. 
Time to go to sleep.
