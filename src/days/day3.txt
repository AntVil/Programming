[gDay 3]

Tody is the day. After a short night you prepare everything on the ship for the jump. As you approach the coordinates of the entrance point, the starlight seems to get dimmer, 
all the stars you see are now warping behind you, leaving only darkness in front of you. Suddenly, all the stars are gone and you can't locate the source of light that is still 
present, it looks unreal, as if the space itself was slightly glowing. 
From this point on you feel like everything you perceive has no real connection to all the things you've known for your whole life - the instuments in the control room don't show any
valid data, looking out the small window gives you a feeling of slight dizziness, even though there is nothing outside but this strange glow.
Are you in yet? Why is this route not feeling "faster"? According to your calculations your speed should now be over 6000 km/s. 
You look out the window again. Is that a toolbag? Is that [+YOUR] Toolbag?? Must be, but how did it get out there? Sh*t.
Now you gotta act fast. What will you do?

I have to get out there. Without these tools I am helpless in the event of an error. Let me get my spacesuit.

It's too risky to get out there. You have to think about what happened a year ago... you don't want that to happen again.

Suiting up has been your favourite part of the spacewalks at the times when [rVlad] was still with you - now you have to help yourself with getting into the airtight material's many layers.
[rVladimir Lituskij] was the second kosmonaut on board of the SPUTNIK 2078, until the horrible incident last year. You don't like to think about it for too long, so you don't. 
Approaching the hatch to leave the spaceship, you turn around and check your safety cord.
The display on the side of the exit says
#StoryBlock = 4.1.1

As the hermetic door opens, you grab onto the siderails to avoid being sucked out by the enormous pressure of the air, that is shooting out the door opening. With it getting wider and wider,
revealing the open space, you look around and check your safety cord again. Without it, there would be no chance of getting back onto the ship, you would be lost in the eternal and never 
ending depths of empty space. 
Floating outside the SPUTNIK was a majestic scenery, the unpainted metal reflected in the mysterious glow, and for a short moment you were caught in this sight, before proceeding to approach the toolbag.
The never ending view into the dark made the 60 meters seem shorter than expected, a few times you were worried that your cord would not be long enough. 
Finally, you get in range of the toolbag, and you can almost grab it but... your attention shifts towards another item, floating not far from you. It's pulsating glow has a strange effect on your eyes.
You turn around and focus it for a while, trying to figure out what it is. There is a feeling... inside of you... that attracts you to it. 

Now you are right between the two items, and you have to descide which one to take with you, the timer on your built in display shows the little time you have left, before the oxygen in your Suit
will be gone.
